abstract: A possibility of creation of stable optical solitons combining one continuous
  and one discrete coordinates, with embedded vorticity, in an array of planar waveguides
  with intrinsic cubic–quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is demonstrated. The same system
  may be realized in terms of the spatiotemporal light propagation in an array of
  tunnel‐coupled optical fibers with the CQ nonlinearity. In contrast with zero‐vorticity
  states, semidiscrete vortex solitons do not exist without the quintic term in the
  nonlinearity. Two types of the solitons, viz., intersite‐centered (IC) and onsite‐centered
  (OC) ones, with even and odd numbers N of actually excited sites in the discrete
  direction, are identified. The modes carrying the embedded vorticity  and 2 are
  considered. In accordance with their symmetry, the vortex solitons of the OC type
  exhibit an intrinsic core, whereas the IC solitons with small N may have a coreless
  structure. Facilitating their creation in the experiment, the modes reported in
  the present work may be much more compact states than their counterparts considered
  in other systems, and they feature strong anisotropy. They can be set in motion
  in the discrete direction, provided that the coupling constant exceeds a certain
  minimum value. Collisions between moving vortex solitons are also considered.
