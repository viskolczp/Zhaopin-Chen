abstract: Abstract We report detailed investigation of the existence and stability
  of mixed and demixed modes in binary atomic Bose–Einstein condensates with repulsive
  interactions in a ring-trap geometry. The stability of such states is examined through
  eigenvalue spectra for small perturbations, produced by the Bogoliubov–de Gennes
  equations, and directly verified by simulations based on the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii
  equations, varying inter- and intra-species scattering lengths so as to probe the
  entire range of miscibility–immiscibility transitions. In the limit of the one-dimensional
  (1D) ring, i.e. a very narrow one, stability of mixed states is studied analytically,
  including hidden-vorticity (HV) modes, i.e. those with opposite vorticities of the
  two components and zero total angular momentum. The consideration of demixed 1D
  states reveals, in addition to stable composite single-peak structures, double-
  and triple-peak ones, above a certain particle-number threshold. In the 2D annular
  geometry, stable demixed states exist both in radial and azimuthal configurations.
  We find that stable radially-demixed states can carry arbitrary vorticity and, counter-intuitively,
  the increase of the vorticity enhances stability of such states, while unstable
  ones evolve into randomly oscillating angular demixed modes. The consideration of
  HV states in the 2D geometry expands the stability range of radially-demixed states.
