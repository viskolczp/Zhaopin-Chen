abstract: 'We introduce a one-dimensional    -symmetric system, which includes the
  cubic self-focusing, a double-well potential in the form of an infinitely deep potential
  box split in the middle by a delta-functional barrier of an effective height Œµ ,
  and constant linear gain and loss, Œ≥ , in each half-box. The system may be readily
  realized in microwave photonics. Using numerical methods, we construct    -symmetric
  and antisymmetric modes, which represent, respectively, the system‚Äôs ground state
  and first excited state, and identify their stability. Their instability mainly
  leads to blowup, except for the case of Œµ =0, when an unstable symmetric mode transforms
  into a weakly oscillating breather, and an unstable antisymmetric mode relaxes into
  a stable symmetric one. At Œµ textgreater0, the stability area is much larger for
  the    -antisymmetric state than for its symmetric counterpart. The stability areas
  shrink with increase of the total power, P . In the linear limit, which corresponds
  to    , the stability boundary is found in an analytical form. The stability area
  of the antisymmetric state originally expands with the growth of Œ≥ , and then disappears
  at a critical value of Œ≥ .  This article is part of the theme issue ‚ÄòDissipative
  structures in matter out of equilibrium: from chemistry, photonics and biology (part
  1)‚Äô.'
