 abstract = {We introduce a one-dimensional



-symmetric system, which includes the cubic self-focusing, a double-well potential in the form of an infinitely deep potential box split in the middle by a delta-functional barrier of an effective height
Œµ
, and constant linear gain and loss,
Œ≥
, in each half-box. The system may be readily realized in microwave photonics. Using numerical methods, we construct



-symmetric and antisymmetric modes, which represent, respectively, the system‚Äôs ground state and first excited state, and identify their stability. Their instability mainly leads to blowup, except for the case of
Œµ
=0, when an unstable symmetric mode transforms into a weakly oscillating breather, and an unstable antisymmetric mode relaxes into a stable symmetric one. At
Œµ
\textgreater0, the stability area is much larger for the



-antisymmetric state than for its symmetric counterpart. The stability areas shrink with increase of the total power,
P
. In the linear limit, which corresponds to



, the stability boundary is found in an analytical form. The stability area of the antisymmetric state originally expands with the growth of
Œ≥
, and then disappears at a critical value of
Œ≥
.
