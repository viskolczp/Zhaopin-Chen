abstract: This article provides a focused review of recent findings which demonstrate,
  in some cases quite counter-intuitively, the existence of bound states with a singularity
  of the density pattern at the center; the states are physically meaningful because
  their total norm converges. One model of this type is based on the 2D Gross–Pitaevskii
  equation (GPE), which combines the attractive potential     ∼  r  − 2       and
  the quartic self-repulsive nonlinearity, induced by the Lee–Huang–Yang effect (quantum
  fluctuations around the mean-field state). The GPE demonstrates suppression of the
  2D quantum collapse, driven by the attractive potential, and emergence of a stable
  ground state (GS), whose density features an integrable singularity     ∼  r  −
  4 / 3       at     r → 0    . Modes with embedded angular momentum exist too, but
  they are unstable. A counter-intuitive peculiarity of the model is that the GS exists
  even if the sign of the potential is reversed from attraction to repulsion, provided
  that its strength is small enough. This peculiarity finds a relevant explanation.
  The other model outlined in the review includes 1D, 2D, and 3D GPEs, with the septimal
  (seventh-order), quintic, and cubic self-repulsive terms, respectively. These equations
  give rise to stable singular solitons, which represent the GS for each dimension
  D, with the density singularity     ∼  r  − 2 / ( 4 − D )      . Such states may
  be considered the results of screening a “bare” delta-functional attractive potential
  by the respective nonlinearities.
