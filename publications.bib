              High-harmonic generation has been driving the development of attosecond science and sources. More recently, high-harmonic generation in solids has been adopted by other communities as a method to study material properties. However, so far high-harmonic generation has only been driven by classical light, despite theoretical proposals to do so with quantum states of light. Here we observe non-perturbative high-harmonic generation in solids driven by a macroscopic quantum state of light, a bright squeezed vacuum, which we generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. The process driven by a bright squeezed vacuum is considerably more efficient in the generation of high harmonics than classical light of the same mean intensity. Due to its broad photon-number distribution, covering states from 0 to 2 × 10

Here, we theoretically propose a realistic spectral method for reconstructing quantum wave function of an electron pulse, free-electron spectral shearing interferometry (FESSI). We use a Wien filter to generate two time-delayed replicas of the electron wave packet and then shift one replica in energy using a light-electron modulator driven by a mid-infrared laser. As a direct demonstration, we numerically reconstruct a pulsed electron wave function with a kinetic energy of 10 keV. FESSI is experimentally feasible and enables us to fully determine distinct orders of spectral phases and their physical implications in quantum foundations and quantum technologies, providing a universal approach to characterize ultrashort electron pulses.

The same system may be realized in terms of the spatiotemporal light propagation in an array of tunnel‐coupled optical fibers with the CQ nonlinearity. In contrast with zero‐vorticity states, semidiscrete vortex solitons do not exist without the quintic term in the nonlinearity. Two types of the solitons, viz., intersite‐centered (IC) and onsite‐centered (OC) ones, with even and odd numbers
                N
                of actually excited sites in the discrete direction, are identified. The modes carrying the embedded vorticity  and 2 are considered. In accordance with their symmetry, the vortex solitons of the OC type exhibit an intrinsic core, whereas the IC solitons with small
                N
                may have a coreless structure. Facilitating their creation in the experiment, the modes reported in the present work may be much more compact states than their counterparts considered in other systems, and they feature strong anisotropy. They can be set in motion in the discrete direction, provided that the coupling constant exceeds a certain minimum value. Collisions between moving vortex solitons are also considered.},

            We consider possibilities to grasp and drag one-dimensional solitons in two-component Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs), under the action of gravity, by tweezers induced by spatially confined spin–orbit (SO) coupling applied to the BEC, with the help of focused laser illumination. Solitons of two types are considered, semi-dipoles and mixed modes. We find critical values of the gravity force, up to which the solitons may be held or transferred by the tweezers. The dependence of the critical force on the magnitude and spatial extension of the localized SO interaction, as well as on the soliton’s norm and speed (in the transfer regime), are systematically studied by means of numerical methods, and analytically with the help of a quasi-particle approximation for the soliton. In particular, a noteworthy finding is that the critical gravity force increases with the increase of the transfer speed (i.e., moving solitons are more robust than quiescent ones). Nonstationary regimes are addressed too, by considering abrupt application of gravity to solitons created in the weightless setting. In that case, solitons feature damped shuttle motion, provided that the gravity force does not exceed a dynamical critical value, which is smaller than its static counterpart. The results may help to design gravimeters based on ultracold atoms.},

	abstract = {This article provides a focused review of recent findings which demonstrate, in some cases quite counter-intuitively, the existence of bound states with a singularity of the density pattern at the center; the states are physically meaningful because their total norm converges. One model of this type is based on the 2D Gross–Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which combines the attractive potential     ∼  r  − 2       and the quartic self-repulsive nonlinearity, induced by the Lee–Huang–Yang effect (quantum fluctuations around the mean-field state). The GPE demonstrates suppression of the 2D quantum collapse, driven by the attractive potential, and emergence of a stable ground state (GS), whose density features an integrable singularity     ∼  r  − 4 / 3       at     r → 0    . Modes with embedded angular momentum exist too, but they are unstable. A counter-intuitive peculiarity of the model is that the GS exists even if the sign of the potential is reversed from attraction to repulsion, provided that its strength is small enough. This peculiarity finds a relevant explanation. The other model outlined in the review includes 1D, 2D, and 3D GPEs, with the septimal (seventh-order), quintic, and cubic self-repulsive terms, respectively. These equations give rise to stable singular solitons, which represent the GS for each dimension D, with the density singularity     ∼  r  − 2 / ( 4 − D )      . Such states may be considered the results of screening a “bare” delta-functional attractive potential by the respective nonlinearities.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We report detailed investigation of the existence and stability of mixed and demixed modes in binary atomic Bose–Einstein condensates with repulsive interactions in a ring-trap geometry. The stability of such states is examined through eigenvalue spectra for small perturbations, produced by the Bogoliubov–de Gennes equations, and directly verified by simulations based on the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii equations, varying inter- and intra-species scattering lengths so as to probe the entire range of miscibility–immiscibility transitions. In the limit of the one-dimensional (1D) ring, i.e. a very narrow one, stability of mixed states is studied analytically, including hidden-vorticity (HV) modes, i.e. those with opposite vorticities of the two components and zero total angular momentum. The consideration of demixed 1D states reveals, in addition to stable composite single-peak structures, double- and triple-peak ones, above a certain particle-number threshold. In the 2D annular geometry, stable demixed states exist both in radial and azimuthal configurations. We find that stable radially-demixed states can carry arbitrary vorticity and, counter-intuitively, the increase of the vorticity enhances stability of such states, while unstable ones evolve into randomly oscillating angular demixed modes. The consideration of HV states in the 2D geometry expands the stability range of radially-demixed states.},
